# Karger's Algorithm

This algorithm is a randomized algorithm that is used to find the min-cut of a set of nodes or vertices in a graph. Karger's Algorithm randomly selects an edge and merges the nodes connected to that edge. It does this progressively until only two nodes remain. There is a chance that the one of the edges selected is incorrect and this means that it does not always provide a correct answer to the problem. But it a very fast approach and using the Karger-Stein variant of this algorithm allows one to reduce the chance of an incorrect answer to a negligible percentage. 

This repo is an example implementation of this the Karger's Algorithm for educational purposes.
